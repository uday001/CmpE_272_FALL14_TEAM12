Features of this project:

Canvas Plus exhibits special capabilities in addition to the existing features offered by the student portals present in the market till-date. Additional features include:

1. Query: This feature enables students to express their queries in middle of a class and get them clarified then and there without any misconception. It can happen irrespective of any inhibitions of a student in a classroom environment. This feature facilitates easy way of communication with the professor by the students in spite of their seating position in the class (not audible) or shy or any inhibitions that a student might have to raise a doubt. A student is free to post his query just by one click and the professor gets a notification about it as soon as its posted which will be answered right away without any misunderstanding. Here students are also given a provision to hide their identity when they post a query in case if they wish themselves to be unknown to the rest of the class.

2. Chapter wise Rating: This feature allows all the students to rate a professor based on his/her teaching in every class. This feature helps in maintaining a realistic & true communication between the student and professor in both directions. It helps the students to be fair on their judgment which would in turn help them in learning better from the professor.  On the other hand professor also gets to know about his teaching and how far it reached the audience so that he gets to improve in his future. Anonymous feature has been incorporated even in this just to ensure fair judgment from the students.

3. Book Reservation: Book Reservation feature in Canvas Plus reduces the studentâ€™s effort in searching for a specific book mentioned by the professor. Professor would reserve a set of books in his account as per the class requirement which helps the students a lot.
